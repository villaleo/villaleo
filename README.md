## Hey there! 👋

I'm Leo, a software development instructor at [Digital NEST](https://digitalnest.org) where I help underserved youth in our community level up their coding skills and break into tech.

When I'm not teaching, you'll find me writing code—mostly in **Go**, with a healthy dose of **Python** thrown in. These days I'm also diving deep into **Rust**, building a POSIX-compliant shell from scratch because apparently I enjoy pain and learning in equal measure.

### What I'm working on

🦀 **[Current project]** – Implementing a POSIX shell in Rust. It's equal parts challenging and rewarding, and I'm learning a ton about systems programming along the way.

### A bit about me

- 🎓 BS in Computer Science
- 💻 Primary languages: Go, Python, Rust (learning)
- 🌱 Passionate about making tech education accessible
- 🔧 Love building tools and exploring systems-level programming
