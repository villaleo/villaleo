# Hii!

I'm Leo Villalobos, a Web Development Instructor at [Digital NEST](https://digitalnest.org/). I studied Computer Science at CSU Monterey Bay and have a concentration in Software Engineering. At Digital NEST, I have the privilege to share my experiences and teach programming and web development to the youth of my community.

I love learning new things and am constantly growing my skillset. [Go](https://go.dev) is my _go_-to programming language, but lately i've been learning more about [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), [Gleam](https://gleam.run/), and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Cool Stuff I'm Working On

* [Calculator API](#): A lightweight, stateless REST API to perform basic arithmetic operations. The goal of this project is to practice my programming and software design skills with Go, utilizing the [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) and [encoding/json](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json) packages to create a stateless API service.
* [EventHub](https://github.com/villaleo/eventhub): An event management API service to create and manage events, similar to services provided by Eventbrite and Meetup. The goal of this project is to learn how to use gRPC, Protocol Buffers (ProtoBuf), and the [go.uber.org/fx](https://pkg.go.dev/go.uber.org/fx) package to create a distributed backend service using dependency injection.
